# Textual Types in Rust

There are two textual types in Rust,
    1. char
    2. String

## What is a Char and what is a String?

In Rust a char is a *singular Character* represented by a **Text Symbol** surrounded by quotes " "/' '.

ex:

```rust
    fn main() {
        let char = "c";

        println!("{}", char);
    }

    // Output: c
```

In Rust a String is a *collection of Characters* represented by a series of **Text Symbols** surrounded by quotes " "/' '.

ex:

```rust
    fn main() {
        let string = "Hello!";

        println!("{}", string);
    }

    //Output: Hello!
```
